# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

# Overview

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is an extended version of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. 
It was popularized by the TV show The Big Bang Theory, originally invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla to reduce the chances of a tie in the traditional game.

This website is the digital version of that game, using the same logic and fun but on your mobile or computer.
